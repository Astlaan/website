**Dear Internet,** we need to have a talk about Thorium. It has many good attributes as a nuclear
fuel, but the things being said on the internet have become largely misleading, if not all-out
inaccurate. Every internet person I meet in real life who finds out that I am a nuclear engineer
asks me why we aren't using the end-all, be-all that is thorium. Every post regarding nuclear
energy on reddit is packed full of comments claiming that Thorium will end all concerns about
nuclear energy and that Uranium is only in use due to some dark dark conspiracy. 

Some places on the internet have become echo-chambers for this kind of thing, and while it's
great to spread awareness of thorium, blatant disregard of the associated challenges is a detriment
to civilization's energy debate. Besides, taking a moderate viewpoint lends credibility to any
cause. This page will try to point people in the right direction if they get lost, using things like
references and whatnot. 

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
Thorium is absolutely a viable and capable fuel, and some advanced nuclear reactors that
use it are among the most exciting designs out there. This page does not debunk Thorium as
a good energy system, it simply debunks a small fraction of the hype from a nuclear
engineer's (who is tasked with designing and implementing these kinds of systems)
perspective. Hype about Thorium and advanced nuclear in general is quite justified! To
learn more about Thorium, we feature <a href="{% link thorium.md %}">a page about Thorium
as nuclear fuel</a>, as well as a big <a href="{% link msr.html %}">page about the fluid
fueled molten salt reactors (MSRs)</a> that are good at using it.
</div>

We love Thorium and think it has a bright future, both in solid and fluid fueled reactors. I
personally have studied it a huge amount and many years ago considered getting a THORIUM vanity
plate. As we claim elsewhere and throughout comment posts abound, we just think that people need to
remain calm and accurate when discussing its merits and demerits.

## Thorium Misconception #1: Development of Thorium-based molten salt reactors got canceled because they couldn't make bombs!
<span class="pull-right"><button type="button" style="cursor: default;" class="btn btn-danger">FALSE</button></span>
Quite False. Not only can they technically (but with much difficulty!) be used to make
bombs (see Misconception #3), but they also were not canceled for any weapons-related
reason. One of the most lucid descriptions of what happened to molten salt reactors like
the LFTR can be found on page 49 of WASH-1222 [1]. There, they describe a few
privately-funded working group studies of the MSBR, including the Molten Salt Breeder
Reactor Associates (consisting of the engineering firm Black &amp; Veatch and five
midwestern utilities) and the Molten Salt Group, headed by Ebasco Services, Inc. (with 5
other industrial firms and fifteen utilities involved). These groups concluded that the
MSBR (basically the LFTR) is attractive and potentially cheaper than LWRs. They said that
a demonstration plant is warranted, but the performance cannot be predicted with
confidence. Then, a list of factors that limit industrial involvement is given. They
include (verbatim): 

* The existing major industrial and utility commitments to the LWR, HTGR, and LMFBR. 
* The lack of incentive for industrial investment in supplying fuel cycle services, such as those
  required for solid fuel reactors.
* The overwhelming manufacturing and operating experience with solid fuel reactors in contrast with
  the very limited involvement with fluid fueled reactors.
* The less advanced state of MSBR technology and the lack of demonstrated solutions to the major
  technical problems associated with the MSBR concept.

Weapons were produced with graphite or heavy-water moderated production reactors and with
gas centrifuge enrichment. Also, thermonuclear weapons require tritium, which is something
that many Thorium MSR designs excel in producing because they often contain Lithium. The
commercial LWRs had nothing to do with making bomb material. Stop the nonsense. 

To be fair, you can rightly argue that U-Pu-fueled reactors got developed in the first place (in the
Manhattan project of the 1940s) for weapons reasons. Back then (before enrichment), Th-fueled
reactors couldn't even go critical, much less make bombs. Natural uranium reactors were the
only way to go. This gave them the technical head start that has arguably led to their dominance.
However, when MSRs were finally given their chance in the 1950s and 60s, their (non-existant)
inability to make bombs was not to blame for the cancellation. 

<a name="myth2"></a>
## Thorium Misconception #2: Thorium reactors never need enrichment!
When people say this, they tend to imply that Th-fueled reactors are the only
reactors that never need enrichment, which isn't true. The nice thing about **any** breeder
reactor (using Th-U or U-Pu) is that **eventually** they can become fissile self-sufficient, meaning
they breed more (or equal) fissile material than they consume. The first electricity-producing
reactor in the world (EBR-I in Idaho, 1951) was created to demonstrate that breeding was possible
(in a liquid-metal cooled fast breeder reactor, or LMFBR). Any breeder reactor concept on the planet
can run without additional enrichment (or some other external source of fissile material) after
their initial startup by breeding fissile material out of fertile material like Th-232 or U-238. But
you have to start your reactor up with fissile material from somewhere. If you take a vat of Thorium
and try to turn it on, you'll be sorely disappointed because it cannot possibly sustain a chain
reaction, under any circumstances. So you start it up with denatured bombs or enriched U-235 and
then it becomes self-sufficient on Th-232 or U-238. I occasionally read misleading things that say
Thorium will just fire right up. Alas, it is not so.

It should be noted, however, that the key advantage of Th fuel is that it allows thermal breeding.
This means that you can start up a Th-based breeder with substantially (between 3 and 10 times) less
fissile material than you need to start an equivalent-powered fast breeder reactor. Once started,
the fast breeder will make far more fissile material (because they make have a better breeding
neutron economy), but the amount of fissile in fast spectrum reactors is always more than in thermal
reactors.  

TL;DR: They do to start up, and U-Pu breeders like the LMFBR can do the same so it's not Thorium specific.

## Thorium Misconception #3: Thorium reactors cannot make bombs!
<span class="pull-right"><button type="button" style="cursor: default;" class="btn btn-danger">FALSE</button></span> 

Nuclear reactors, by their nature, split atoms in a chain reaction to release energy
slowly, safely, and under control. If a nefarious operator controls such a system, they
can use various means to extract the fissile nuclear fuel atoms and concentrate them into
a weapon. Thus, all reactors require safeguards and inspections from the UN nuclear
watchdog, the IAEA. This includes Thorium reactors.

Thorium reactors work by breeding Th-232 through Protactinium-233
(27.4 day half life) and into Uranium-233, which is fissile. Pa-233 is a pretty strong neutron
absorber, so the MSBR (basically the LFTR) has to extract it from the core once it is produced and
let it decay to U-233 away from the neutrons. Once the U-233 is created, it gets fed back into the
reactor. Well, if you went rogue, you could build up a little excess reactivity (maybe add some
low-enriched U235?) and then divert the freshly-bred U-233 into a weapons stream to make U-233
nuclear bombs. It may be difficult to do this several times without going subcritical, but it
certainly could be done. A U-233-filled bomb has been tested before, and it worked just fine.   

Here&rsquo;s a quote from a Frank von Hippel paper on the subject [2]: 

<blockquote style="margin: 1em 3em;
font-size: small;
padding: .5em 1em;
border-left: 5px solid #fce27c;
background-color: #f6ebc1; "><p>&quot;On the one hand, gamma radiation from U-232 makes the U-233 from high-
burnup U-233-thorium fuel cycles more of a radiation hazard than plutonium.
On the other hand, because of its low rate of spontaneous-neutron emission,
U-233 can, unlike plutonium, be used in simple gun-type fission-weapon
designs without significant danger of the yield being reduced by premature
initiation of the fission chain reaction&quot;</p></blockquote>

And another (also [2]):

<blockquote style="margin: 1em 3em;
font-size: small;
padding: .5em 1em;
border-left: 5px solid #fce27c;
background-color: #f6ebc1; "><p>&quot;In the case of the molten-salt
U-233 breeder reactor, it was proposed to have continual chemical processing
of a stream of liquid fuel. Such an arrangement also offers a way to completely bypass the U-232
contamination problem because 27-day half-life Pa-
233 could be separated out before it decays into U-233.&quot;</p></blockquote>

Options to make bomb-making less favorable include fostering substantial U-232 contamination in the
reactor and denaturing the U-233 with U-238 that keeps the in-reactor inventory safe. Both of these
options can conceptually be bypassed in the Pa separation route though. Besides, U-232 isn't
releasing the gammas, its decay products are, and it has a **70 year** half-life. So you can just
chemically purify your stolen goods and then make the bomb anytime within the next decade or so. 

There are about a dozen other ways people try to amp up the proliferation resistance of various
fuel cycles. But they always forget that the owner of such a plant can secretly install a chemical
cell that does Pa separation. 

Really, most civilian power to bombs proliferation paths are mythical,
in any reactor, because they're so difficult! But since the consequences of proliferation
are so dire, nuclear power plants need to have baseline proliferation safeguards in place.
Thorium-powered reactors, whether fluid fueled or not, are no exception.

## Thorium Misconception #4: There's more Thorium than Uranium, and that is really important!
<span class="pull-right"><button type="button" style="cursor: default;" class="btn btn-warning">MISLEADING</button></span> 
This one is mostly true, but also partially false. The average crustal concentration of Thorium is
0.00060%, compared with 0.00018% for Uranium [3]. But, the oceanic abundance of Th is
4x10<sup>-12</sup>%, compared with 3.3x10<sup>-7</sup>% (mass percent). Considering that the oceans
contain 1.4x10<sup>21</sup> kg of water, that amounts to 56,000 tonnes of Th and 4.62 billion tonnes
of Uranium. Moreover, mining the entire crust is difficult, whereas the ocean delivers to you. While
seawater extraction of uranium is not yet competitive with traditional mining (it&rsquo;s hovering
around 4x more expensive), it is possible and may become economical in the near future. So while
Misconception 4 is correct with respect to the crust, it&rsquo;s not necessarily relevant from a
global resource perspective, and there may very well be more accessible Uranium available to us. The
crust is estimated to weight around 1.0x10<sup>22</sup> kg, so overall, there is actually more Th.
If you want to get very technical and start including asteroid and star mining, the abundance of Th
in the universe is estimated at about 2x that of Uranium.

If you&rsquo;re the Indian government, however, you&rsquo;ll note that you have hundreds of
thousands of tonnes of Th but basically zero U. So you guys might want some Th-power to secure a
domestic supply! China has about an estimated 50% more known U than Th [4,5].

Another point, if you look at the known reserves of economically extractable Thorium vs. Uranium
[4,5], you&rsquo;ll find that they are both nearly identical (though many people argue that we can
economically extract Th from lots of common sands). And remember, if we close the fuel cycle
(whether using Th-U or U-Pu), the fuel resources are a non-issue for millenia.  

<a name="myth5"></a>
## Thorium Misconception #5: Thorium reactors are the only ones that make waste that is safe in hundreds of years!
<span class="pull-right"><button type="button" style="cursor: default;" class="btn btn-danger">FALSE</button></span> 
Undenatured Thorium cycles certainly produce fewer transuranic elements (Np, Pu, Am, Cm,+), which
are the major dangerous nuclides in <a href="{% link waste.md %}">nuclear waste</a> in the 10,000+
year timeframe. In fact, the long-term decay heat from Thorium-MSRs can be orders of magnitude lower
than that from traditional reactors. However, this same capability exists in many other reactor
concepts, including U-Pu fueled <a href="{% link fast-reactor.html %}">fast reactors</a> with
reprocessing. So, if someone says that MSR/LFTR waste is better than traditional LWR waste, they are
correct. If they say Thorium is the only game in town that can reduce waste like this, then they are
not correct.

<a name="myth6"></a>
## Thorium Misconception #6: Thorium reactors and Molten Salt Reactors are the same thing!
<span class="pull-right"><button type="button" style="cursor: default;" class="btn btn-danger">NOT ALWAYS</button></span> 
On one hand you can choose between a Th-U fuel cycle and a U-Pu fuel cycle. On the other hand, you
can choose between a fluid fueled reactor (like a MSR) or a solid fueled reactor (like a LWR or a
sodium-cooled fast reactor). Now, the Th-U cycle works really really well with MSRs, and
that&rsquo;s why they are often discussed together. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with this, but
it&rsquo;s nice to know what benefits come from which choice. The Th-U fuel cycle can be (and has
been) used in solid fueled reactors and the U-Pu fuel cycle can be (and has been) used in MSRs.

The attributes of a system that come from choosing a fluid fueled reactor include: the ability to
have passive safety by draining the fuel into cooled storage tanks, online fission product removal,
low/zero fabrication cost, low fissile requirement, low excess reactivity (since you refuel online)
[6]

The attributes that come from choosing the Th-U fuel cycle over the U-Pu cycle include: the
possibility of thermal breeding (as demonstrated in the Shippingport LWR), the reduced production of
minor actinides (see Misconception #5), allowing nuclear waste to be safer without aggressive
reprocessing, and the ability to use the Thorium mineral base instead of the Uranium minerals
(useful if your country has Th but no U. See Misconception #4).
