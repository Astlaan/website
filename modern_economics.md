NOTE: This is an early draft!

Fundamentally, nuclear power plants are more expensive **to build** than
conventional power plants. The process of splitting atoms itself is always
accompanied by powerful radiation energy that must be shielded by several feet
of dense concrete. Furthermore, atoms produced in any reactor (e.g. fission
products and transuranics) are radioactive and slowly release their energy as
radiation, quickly at first (requiring fail-safe cooling even after reactor
shutdown) and then slower for many years (requiring careful waste handling and
disposal).

Costs due to radiation protection include:
* Increased construction costs to provide shielding (including increased floor loading
  due to the weight of the shielding), special facilities to handle radioactive 
  materials and equipment.
* Increased costs because it takes time to perform work while following radiological
  procedures

The advantage of nuclear is in the energy density of the fuel. 
## Cost dynamics from the 1970s to the 2010s
Most NPPs are inherently complex systems. They directly convert mass to
energy by splitting atoms and convert the heat into electricity.

### Public concern grows, and so do costs
As NPPs became better understood, larger, and more common, regulations on their licensing,
construction, and operation became more stringent. This had several direct effects:

* **Quality assurance (QA)** programs were instated requiring careful inspection,
  qualification, and monitoring of safety-related equipment. This increased the time and
  manpower needed to design, install, and maintain equipment.

* **Improved redundancy** in safety-related cables, instruments, controls, backup power,
  shutdown mechanisms, and core cooling required more equipment and sufficient space to
  separate redundant trains. For example, after the 1975 [Browns Ferry
  fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browns_Ferry_Nuclear_Plant#Unit_1_fire), redundant
  cables required 3-hour firewalls between them.

### The astounding rise of capacity factor

### Nuclear renaissance?
Starting around 2003, phenomenal NPP operation and capacity factors combined with growing
concerns about climate change and volatile fossil fuel prices to spur what we all called a
Nuclear Renaissance. We expected new builds to start happening again in the USA, largely
featuring new reactors like the AP1000 and ABWR. Nuclear enrollments soared at
universities.


## The current situation
As of 2019, the peaceful atom now churns away in 450 commercial nuclear power plants
around the world, generating nearly 400 gigawatts of clean-air electricity without carbon
emissions. But it has not replaced fossil fuel worldwide, which remains above 80% of the
world's primary energy. Indeed in many parts of the world fossil fuel is replacing it. The
direct reason for this is economics: it is often more expensive to prop up and operate a
nuclear industry than it is to build a fracked natural gas turbine or coal plant.

### Existing plants

In the USA, fracking and horizontal drilling have opened up vast new resources of natural
gas, which is better than coal from an air pollution point of view, but about as bad from
a carbon-emissions point of view (when you factor in well and pipeline leaks).
Additionally, natural gas turbines are highly efficient, finely tuned machines. A large
unit can be built for $1B in a few years and operated by a small crew. They ramp up and
down in power readily. As a result, electricity prices in deregulated markets have fallen. 
As LNG export ports activate in the Gulf of Mexico, cheap American fracked gas is now
influencing the world energy markets.

Nuclear plants do not benefit from the new access to cheap fracked fuel and experience
this as a reduction in electricity sales revenue. Thus, the nuclear industry must reduce
its operating costs to survive.

The NEI published many results from their [Delivering the Nuclear
Promise](https://www.nei.org/resources/delivering-the-nuclear-promise) effort, attempting
to pinpoint the highest-impact efficiency gains for the operating fleet. This included a
list of Efficiency Bulletins that go into some detail about a few dozen key operational
inefficiencies that can be improved upon.

Meanwhile, clean energy mandates are varied in whether or not they include nuclear energy. The
environmentalist movement itself dates back to opposition against atmospheric nuclear
weapons testing, and nuclear power plants have long been associated with them (an
association not helped by accidents at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima). 

But the low-carbon nature of nuclear power is clear and undisputed, and the [actual
data](https://ourworldindata.org/what-is-the-safest-form-of-energy) comparing the health
effects of fossil fuels (~6 million deaths/year) to nuclear (up to 4000 deaths ever) is
hard to ignore. The ensuing debate here reaches well beyond science and into personal
identity itself. Progress is being made as this identity issue is being [recognized by
climate-inspired advocates](https://www.titansofnuclear.com/benheard) of nuclear energy.


### New builds

Recent new construction of nuclear plants in the west has been fraught with boondoggle.
The troubles with the Westinghouse AP1000 have been the most distressing to me personally,
since the design was to be the conquering hero of the Nuclear Renaissance I was so excited
about in nuclear engineering undergrad back in the mid-2000s. The July 2017 cancellation
of the two AP1000s at [VC
Summer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_C._Summer_Nuclear_Generating_Station#Units_2_and_3),
the astronomical [delays and overruns at Plant
Vogtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogtle_Electric_Generating_Plant#Units_3_and_4), and
the [bankruptcy of
Westinghouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westinghouse_Electric_Company#2017_Chapter_11_bankruptcy)
were all devastating.

Late-stage regulatory-enforced [re-design of the aircraft impact shield building for
AP1000s caused part of the
delay](http://ansnuclearcafe.org/2014/11/12/root-cause-of-vogtle-and-vc-summer-delays/),
but a Bechtel report released by the South Carolina Governor's office highlights [lack of
experience, contract misalignment, and lack of detailed engineering
design](http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/C-US-governor-releases-report-on-VC-Summer-flaws-06091701.html).

Elsewhere, the EPR builds in Finland (Olkiluoto 3), France (Flamanville 3), and the UK
(Hinkley Point C) are all many years late and many billions of Euros overbudget.

In China, the Taishan EPRs fared better and entered commercial operation in 2018 
and 2019.  In fact, 9 new gigawatt-class PWRs entered commercial operation in 2018, all in
Russia and China.  The Russians, South Koreans, and (before Fukushima) Japanese have
effectively perfected their standardized large LWR designs and can deliver them in
reasonable times and budgets.  China now has experience building a wide variety of
different reactor models.

## Improving modern nuclear power economics

### Market forces

### Standardization

### Economies of mass production

### Economies of scale

### Multi-unit sites

Most nuclear plants requires some common auxiliary buildings and equipment: access roads,
guardhouse, office and visitor center, radwaste building, machine shop, laboratory, fuel
handling facilities, demineralized water system, fire station, well pumphouse, parts
warehouse, compressed air systems, etc.

2019 saw some [pretty impressive accomplishments in nuclear](https://www.powermag.com/top-6-nuclear-power-achievements-of-the-year/).
