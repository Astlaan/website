title: Sodium Graphite Reactors
description: > 
    The Sodium Graphite Reactor (SGR) is a nearly-forgotten nuclear reactor
    design intended to make economical power by combining the
    high-temperature/low-pressure nature of sodium metal coolant with the fuel
    efficiency enabled by a graphite moderator.

In the 1950s, hordes of nuclear reactor designers were rushing to find out
[which combination of coolant, moderator, and fuel types]({% link
reactors.md %}#types) would be the most economical for commercial power
production. Along the way, someone came up with the idea of using 
sodium metal coolant with graphite moderator. The idea here was to capture
the following benefits:

* Sodium metal coolant can be brought to higher temperature than high-pressure water, 
  allowing higher thermal efficiency (more heat can be converted to electricity when 
  the heat is higher temperature). Thus, you can get more revenue for the same amount
  of nuclear heat and equipment, and therefore be more economical.

* Sodium metal coolant remains at low pressure even at these high temperature. Thus,
  the thickness of pipes and protection equipment to deal with high-pressure
  leaks in water-cooled reactors can be reduced/eliminated.

* Graphite moderator allows reactors to work with very little fissile mass 
  and [enrichment]({% link enrichment.md %}). 
  This allows operation with natural or low-enriched uranium, as opposed to 
  sodium-cooled [fast reactors]({% link fast-reactor.md %}), which require ~12% or higher
  enrichment (or fissile concentration) to start up and maintain a neutron chain reaction.
  
The first two benefits are shared with the far more well-known sodium-cooled fast reactor
(SFR) design, but the last one is what's special about SGRs. When high-fissile fuel such
as HALEU or HEU or Plutonium is a little hard to come by, SGRs shine.

The first vocal champion of the SGR design was [Chauncey
Starr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauncey_Starr), known for later founding
the non-profit, [Electrical Power Research Institute
(EPRI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Power_Research_Institute). He edited an entire volume
that was released globally at the 2nd Atoms for Peace convention in 1958.



As was typical in the [history of reactor development]({%link reactor_history.md
%}), we developed, built, and operated two SGRs:

* A reactor experiment: Sodium Reactor Experiment (SRE) 29 miles NW of Los Angeles, California.
* A power prototype: Hallam Nuclear Power Facility (HNPF) 18 miles SE of Lincoln, Nebraska.
