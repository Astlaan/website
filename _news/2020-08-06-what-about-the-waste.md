# What about the waste?
##### {{ page.date | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}
Because nuclear waste is one of the primary issues that comes up in discussions about
nuclear, we decided to do two big things:

* Update our [Nuclear Waste page]({% link waste.md %}) with better descriptions and more
  pictures
* Get a more memorable URL directly to the waste page: [whataboutthewaste.com](https://whataboutthewaste.com)

These things are now done. Please enjoy.
