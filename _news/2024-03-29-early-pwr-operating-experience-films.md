I couldn't be happier to be announcing the addition of six(!) more digitized
historical nuclear films to the world's collection, thanks to the generosity of
[Last Energy](https://www.lastenergy.com/). This is our biggest batch of
digitizations yet!

## Army Package Power Reactor (1957)

The Army needed reactors that could be packaged up and air-lifted to remote
bases to provide power. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory designed a compact and
simple pressurized water reactor that could achieve this. A prototype was
suggested, and so the SM-1 was built and operated in Ft. Belvoir, Virginia. This
film explains the package power program and shows construction and initial
operation of the SM-1, aka the APPR-1.

This is film [88093]({%link old-videos.md%}#army-package-power-reactor) in our catalog.

## Atomic Power and the United States (1957)

This one summarizes the growing need for non-fossil electricity sources and
explains how the USA is approaching the development of economical nuclear power
by building a variety of promising concepts, including the Fast Breeder Reactor
(EBR-1 in Idaho) Sodium Graphite Reactor (SRE in CA), the Pressurized Water
Reactor (APPR-1/SM-1 and Shippingport), the Aqueous Homogeneous Reactor (HRE at
Oak Ridge), and the Boiling Water Reactor (EBWR at Argonne).

## Operating Experience, Indian Point

The third international "Atoms for Peace" conference occurred in Geneva in 1964.
The US delegation produced 24 films summarizing progress in nuclear in the USA.
The following was one of them. As the film explains, concerns about long-term
uranium supply were serious in 1955, so the Indian Point 1 reactor used thorium
as the fertile material instead of U-238. This was the first commercial-scale
use of a thorium fuel cycle.

(Not mentioned in the film is the fact that the second core moved away from
thorium to reduce cost, and because much more uranium had been discovered than
initially expected)

## Naval research laboratory reactor

In the early days of [reactor history]({% link reactor_history.md %}), between
1942 and 1965, we built literally dozens of different kinds of nuclear reactors,
hoping that one model would achieve economic parity with conventional coal
powerplants, thereby ushering in an era of commercial nuclear power. Before
then, reactors had only been put to good use in producing rare materials and
powering submarines, remote locations, and aircraft carriers.

But then the Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) emerged as a reliable and compact
system that could come close to the cost of coal. When the first few of these
reactors operated, short films were made documenting their experience.

Following up on our previous digitization efforts, we now are excited to bring
you films documenting the operation of the first large-scale PWRs: Yankee Rowe
and Indian Point 1. The scanning of these films was made possible by the
generosity of Last Energy.

The first is about [Yankee Rowe](https://whatisnuclear.com/old-videos.html#88209):
