        <h1>What is a moderator?</h1>
        <h5>By Nick Touran, Ph.D.</h5>

         <p>The <em>moderator</em> of a nuclear reactor is a substance that slows neutrons
         down. In traditional nuclear reactors, the moderator is the same thing as the
         coolant: it&rsquo;s water! When fast neutrons strike the hydrogen atoms in
         H<sub>2</sub>O, they slow down a lot (like a billiard ball striking another).
         There are other good moderators like graphite, beryllium, and more.</p>

           
        <h2>Why moderate?</h2>
        <p>When an incoming neutron causes the nucleus of an atom to split, other neutrons
        are released at very high speed. If at least one (on average) of these neutrons
        can be made to cause split another fuel atom, a sustained chain reaction is
        possible. As it happens, fuel atoms (like uranium) are more likely to absorb a
        neutron whizzing by if it&rsquo;s going slow (see Figure 1). So, many reactor
        designs use moderators to make a chain reaction easier to attain. </p>

    probable fission is for slower neutrons. Also note logarithmic scale. </p>

        <h2>Choosing a moderator material</h2>
            <p>Some materials are better at slowing down neutrons than others.
            Conservation of energy and momentum laws explain that a neutron (mass 1)
            cannot slow down much after a collision with a heavy nucleus, like a fuel atom
            (mass 235). However, in a collision with Hydrogen (mass 1), a neutron can in
            fact slow down very far. Imagine a ping-pong ball bouncing off a bowling ball,
            as opposed to the same ping-pong ball colliding with another ping-pong ball.
            Clearly, the ping-pong ball will do a better job of slowing things
            down. So what material has a lot of light elements like hydrogen in it and
            will make a good moderator? Good old H<sub>2</sub>O does the trick, giving the
            name to light-water reactors. </p>

    <h2>Why have separate moderator and fuel lumps?</h2>
    <p>You <em>could</em> mix your moderator and fuel together, but it&rsquo;s much better
    to keep them separate. Neutrons can be parasitically absorbed by fuel as they are
    slowing down in reactions that compete with fission. So if you can have a fast neutron
    move into the moderator where it will slow down &quot;in peace,&quot; i.e. where there
    are no strong neutron absorbers, and then have it re-enter the fuel as a slow neutron
    where the probability of fission is extremely high, then it will be easier to make
    your chain reaction work. This fact was required in the first reactor, CP-1, which
    used natural uranium because there was no enriched uranium back in the early 1940s.

    <h2>What is a Thermal vs. Fast reactor?</h2>
            <p>Thermal neutrons have moderators that allow many neutrons to slow down to
            thermal energies (i.e. the speed that atoms are vibrating in the surrounding
            materials due to their temperature) whereas fast reactors don&rsquo;t have a
            moderator and their neutrons stay at high energies (i.e. they move fast). </p>
