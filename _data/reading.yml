     title: The First Nuclear Era
     date: 1994
     url: https://www.osti.gov/biblio/175787
     description: >
        As a young nuclear engineer, I was enchanted by Alvin Weinberg's autobiography, The First
        Nuclear Era. He took me through a very personal history of concepts I have studied, and
        struck many chords by recounting such things as the day the term "breeder reactor" was
        thought up. Weinberg discusses pioneering neutron transport, working with the Manhattan
        Project, the origins of the national labs, how he influenced today's dominance of
        light-water reactors, and a history of the various goings on that brought nuclear power to
        where it is today.
