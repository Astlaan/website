  quote: >
      Green energy alone is not enough to meet demand.  We need a mix. That's
      why I'm in favor of nuclear energy. For me it is one of the safest
      methods of generating power.

      Nuclear is ideal for dealing with climate change, because it is the only
      carbon-free, scalable energy source that’s available 24 hours a day. The problems
      with today’s reactors, such as the risk of accidents, can be solved through
      innovation.

  #      You bring up an important part of our energy mix which is nuclear. This is
  #      absolutely a critical part of this conversation. One thing I would just like to
  #      clarify is that the Green New Deal does leave the door open for nuclear. You are
  #      right we name renewables like wind and solar specifically. The door is open for
  #      nuclear but we also have to make sure that community input and the technology is
  #      vetted. I do believe there is an open door there.

      efficiency, more incentives. That means building a new generation of safe, clean
      nuclear power plants in this country.

      It’s like half the people that were out there saying “No nukes! Shut down
      the power plants!” are now realizing nuclear is the best way to go for
      energy for the future. I think it’s natural to reexamine your beliefs as
      you age up.”

  title: US Senator (R-AK)
  quote: >
      We are holding this hearing because nuclear energy must be a national
      priority.  It provides about 20 percent of our nation’s electricity, and
      63 percent of our emissions-free electricity.  It is safe and extremely
      reliable.  When cold winters hit the Northeast and the flow of natural gas
      is restricted, nuclear plants continue to provide electricity to
      residents, literally saving lives.  When the wind isn’t blowing and the
      sun isn’t shining, nuclear is still providing essential baseload capacity.
      For any number of good reasons, nuclear has to remain part of the energy
      mix

      And for us to say ‘Oh we’re not going to use all the tools that we have to try to
      solve it’ is crazy. We have to use all of the things that we have at
      our disposal and clearly nuclear power, next generation nuclear power especially,
      has tremendous potential to be a big part of the solution.

      But I think we will have to curb our tendency to burn fossil fuels. And I think the
      big companies are beginning to realize themselves that you can’t make money that
      way. What replaces it, I hope, is nuclear, but probably they’ll mess about with
      renewables for awhile until they find their way to nuclear.

      Zero emissions.
