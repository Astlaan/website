    This nontechnical, documentary film, for junior-high-school- through
    college-level audiences, covers the historical background, and the de- sign,
    construction, sea trials, and initial port calls of the N.S. Savannah, the
    world's first nuclear-powered merchant ship. The film begins with a brief
    review of America's maritime growth, starting with May 22,
    1819, and the story of the S.S. Savannah, the first ship to cross the ocean
    under steam power. The design of the N.S. Savannah and its atomic reactor and
    propulsion system are explained with animation and live action photography.
    After keel laying, various phases of the ship's construction are covered, and
    the assembling and testing of the reactor are explained. The ceremonies
    involving the launching of the ship are shown, followed by impressive scenes
    showing the loading of the reactor with its nuclear fuel under surgically clean
    conditions. The special training of the crew is reviewed. The film then shows
    the sea trials of the ship, during which time the reactor is slowly brought up
    to full power. After sea trials, the trip of the N.S. Savannah to her first port
    of call, Savannah, Georgia, is covered, followed by her voyage through the
    Panama Canal and visits to Hawaii and West Coast ports. As the ship leaves for
    foreign ports, the film ends with a statement by President Lyndon B. Johnson on
    the significance of the Nuclear Ship Savannah as a pioneer in the use of nuclear
    power for world trade to benefit all mankind.

  description: > 
    Designed for high school through college-level audiences, this film surveys
    the role of the USAEC in guiding and supporting the nation's atomic energy
    programs. It reviews many of those programs, including both the peaceful
    applications of nuclear energy and those involved in national defense.  The
    film opens with a visit to the community of Buchanan, New York, site of
    Consolidated Edison's Indian Point atomic power station. The enlightened
    attitude of the community toward the atomic plant is revealed as the camera
    visits the mayor of the town, teachers and school children, housewives,
    businessmen and plant personnel. Following a review of the atom's place in
    national defense, the film goes into the mining of uranium and processing into
    fissionable materials.

    It then explores the broad role of the USAEC, briefly discussing the make-up of
    the Commission and showing an actual Commission meet- ing in session, as the
    Commissioners, General Manager and Director of Regulation engage in an important
    discussion involving aerospace safety. The USAEC 's responsibility in all facets
    of atomic safety is covered as the film shows the testing of a nuclear power
    source for a space satellite and the design and testing of a power reactor. The
    pro- cessing and storage of radioactive waste is discussed.

    After reviewing some aspects of the peaceful uses of nuclear explosives,
    including Projects Sedan and Gnome, the film next turns to a survey of
    radioisotopes and their many applications. Isotope production at Oak Ridge is
    shown. Some of the uses of radioisotopes in medicine are demonstrated at the
    hospital at USAEC's Brookhaven National Laboratory. Some agricultural
    applications of radioisotopes are shown, including the irradiation of the
    screwworm fly and the use of radiation for food preservation.

    The radioisotope as a source of power is covered during a brief re- view of the
    SNAP (Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power) program. After a visit to Brookhaven
    National Laboratory to explore some aspects of high energy physics at the
    Alternating Gradient Synchrotron, the film concludes with some statements by Dr.
    Glenn T. Seaborg, Chairman of the USAEC, concerning the important future of the
    nation's atomic energy program and the role the atom will play in benefiting
    all mankind.

    laboratory to conduct lunar surface experiments. After they depart for earth,
    the laboratory—known as ALSEP, Apollo Lunar Surface Packages will remain,
    transmitting its research data to receiving stations on earth for several
    years. ALSEP is powered by electricity from atomic energy a highly reliable,
    radioisotope-fueled thermoelectric generator called SNAP-27. The film
    explains how tiny grains of radioactive plutonium-238 in a sealed fuel
    capsule generate heat which, in turn, generates electricity directly by means
    of thermocouples. In simulated action on earth, we see astronauts unloading 
    ALSEP and inserting the nuclear fuel capsule. The film discusses the type of
    lunar surface information in the radioisotope-powered ALSEP will send back 
    to earth, and the temperature and stresses and vibration tests to which SNAP-27 has
    been subjected. Technology developed for SNAP-27 also will be of assistance
    to the aircraft and other industries.

  description: >
    This film covers Project Gnome the first nuclear detonation conducted under
    the USAEC's Plowshare Program for development of peaceful uses of nuclear
    explosives from its planning stage through the early months of the
    post-detonation period when scientists entered the man-created cavern.
    Project Gnome was an experiment under the technical direction of the Lawrence
    Radiation Laboratory involving the detonation on December 10, 1961, of a 3.1
    kiloton nuclear explosive in a chamber about 1200 feet below the earth's
    surface in the Salado Salt Basin, a thick subsurface salt bed about 25 miles
    southeast of Carlsbad, New Mexico. The force of the explosion created an
    under- ground cavern which today measures about 170 feet across and almost 90
    feet high. Animation is used to explain the scope of Project Gnome and its
    integrated scientific and technical programs. Project Gnome, one of the most
    heavily instrumented nuclear detonations ever con- ducted, was designed to
    provide scientific and technical information on ive objectives: (1) To
    determine characteristics and physical effects of underground detonations in
    a salt medium; (2) to explore feasibility of converting energy produced into
    electricity; (3) to make neutron cross-measurements which would contribute
    to scientific knowledge; (4) to provide information on design of nuclear
    explosives for peaceful purposes; and, (5) to investigate the practicability
    of recovering useful radioisotopes. Topics covered: geological and safety
    considerations explored in selection of the Gnome site; drilling and
    construction of the shaft, underground access tunnel and shot chamber; the
    surface installations; special monitoring and other programs conducted to
    afford safety to the public; the seismic and radiological monitoring
    programs; principal equipment and instrumentation installation in support of
    the complex scientific experiments; the pre-shot news media tour; the
    surface movement above ground zero at the moment of detonation; the escape
    of vapor from the shaft; recovery of scientific data and equipment; and
    entry into the underground cavity in May 1962. Dr. Edward Teller, University
    of California nuclear physicist, discusses the objectives of the Plowshare
    Program and the preliminary results of Project Gnome in the opening and
