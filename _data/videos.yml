    This semitechnical film offers an extensive tour of the facilities of the
    Puerto Rico Nuclear Center (operated for the USAEC by the University of
    Puerto Rico) and a study of the Center's curricula and research pro- grams.
    The Center was conceived primarily to aid the Latin American nations in
    developing skills essential to nuclear energy activity, by providing
    graduate- and post graduate-level education and research opportunities. At
    the Center's Bio-Medical building, work is shown involving radioisotopes and
    their clinical applications, and other nu- clear work related to biology,
    chemistry, and medicine is reviewed. Study and research in nuclear
    engineering and technology, health phys- ics, agriculture and marine biology
    are shown at the Center's reactor and laboratories located on the campus of
    the University of Puerto Rico's College of Agriculture and Engineering, and
    aboard the Center's oceanographic ship.

    This nontechnical film, suitable for all audience levels,
    summarizes the nature of the USAEC exhibit on atomic energy in agriculture at
    the first World Agricultural Fair, New Delhi, during the winter 1959-60.
    Various views show the crowds examining the research reactor, master- slave
    manipulator, the gamma pool, the technical information center, and exhibits
    featuring radioactive tracers in agricultural re- search, plant mutations by
    gamma irradiation, atomic energy work in medicine, screwworm fly eradication,
    food sterilization by irradiation, etc.

    This nontechnical, documentary film, for junior-high-school- through
    college-level audiences, covers the historical background, and the de- sign,
    construction, sea trials, and initial port calls of the N.S. Savannah, the
    world's first nuclear-powered merchant ship. The film begins with a brief
    review of America's maritime growth, starting with May 22,
    1819, and the story of the S.S. Savannah, the first ship to cross the ocean
    under steam power. The design of the N.S. Savannah and its atomic reactor and
    propulsion system are explained with animation and live action photography.
    After keel laying, various phases of the ship's construction are covered, and
    the assembling and testing of the reactor are explained. The ceremonies
    involving the launching of the ship are shown, followed by impressive scenes
    showing the loading of the reactor with its nuclear fuel under surgically clean
    conditions. The special training of the crew is reviewed. The film then shows
    the sea trials of the ship, during which time the reactor is slowly brought up
    to full power. After sea trials, the trip of the N.S. Savannah to her first port
    of call, Savannah, Georgia, is covered, followed by her voyage through the
    Panama Canal and visits to Hawaii and West Coast ports. As the ship leaves for
    foreign ports, the film ends with a statement by President Lyndon B. Johnson on
    the significance of the Nuclear Ship Savannah as a pioneer in the use of nuclear
    power for world trade to benefit all mankind.

    This semitechnical film, which is a sequel to the 1958 film "Dresden Nuclear
    Power Station," covers the design and development of a large dual-cycle
    boiling-water reactor the 180,000-kw Dresden Nuclear Power Station built by
    General Electric Company (GE) for the Com- monwealth Edison Company, Chicago,
    and the Nuclear Power Group, Inc., and the history of the project from its
    beginning in 1955 to its completion in 1959. The film shows major stages of
    development, in- cluding clearance of the site 47 miles southwest of Chicago;
    ground- breaking; construction of foundations, sphere, and other buildings;
    manufacture of the containment vessel and fuel; shipment and arrival of major
    components; installation of the reactor core, reactor vessel, and
    turbine-generator; testing of completed installations; and the station's
    "going critical." The film also includes scenes relating to development work
    for Dresden carried out at GE's Vallecitos Atomic Laboratory near Pleasanton,
    Calif.

    This film shows the setting and location of the reactor built jointly by USAEC
    and the Consumers' Public Power District of Nebraska. An ex- planation of this
    type of reactor, using a liquid metal coolant, is given stressing its
    advantages. The working of the plant is shown in anima- tion. Live footage
    shows construction of the reactor containment ves- sel, its transportation
    from Philadelphia to Hallam, moderator fabrica- tion and installation,
    installation and operation of safety rods, use of an intermediate heat
    exchanger, installation of steam piping and the installation of the turbine
    and generator. Also shown is fuel handling, cleaning and storage cells, fuel
    fabrication, and testing
