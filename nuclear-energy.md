## What is nuclear energy? 

<div class="pull-right"><img src="img/lamp.jpg" alt="A lamp" title="A Lamp" /></div>

Everything around you is made up of tiny objects called atoms. Most of the mass of each atom is
concentrated in the center (which is called the nucleus), and the rest of the mass is in the cloud
of electrons surrounding the nucleus. Protons and neutrons are subatomic particles that comprise the
nucleus. 

Under certain circumstances, the nucleus of a very large atom can split in two. In this process, a
certain amount of the large atom's mass is converted to pure energy following Einstein's famous
formula E = MC<sup>2</sup>, where M is the small amount of mass and C is the speed of light (a
*very* large number). In the 1930s and '40s, humans discovered this energy and recognized its
potential as a weapon. Technology developed in the Manhattan Project successfully used this energy
in a chain reaction to create nuclear bombs. Soon after World War II ended, the newfound energy
source found a home in the propulsion of the nuclear navy, providing submarines with engines that
could run for over a year without refueling. This technology was quickly transferred to the public
sector, where commercial power plants were developed and deployed to produce electricity. Read more

## Nuclear Energy Today

Nuclear reactors produce just under 20% of the electricity in the USA. There are over 400 power
reactors in the world (about 100 of these are in the USA). They produce base-load electricity 24/7
without emitting pollutants (including CO<sub>2</sub>) into the atmosphere. They do, however, create
<a href="{% link radioactivity.md %}">radioactive</a> nuclear <a
href="{% link waste.md %}">waste</a> which must be stored carefully.

## Fission and Fusion

There are two fundamental nuclear processes considered for energy production: fission and fusion. 

* **Fission** is the energetic splitting of large atoms such as Uranium or Plutonium into two
  smaller atoms, called fission products. To split an atom, you have to hit it with a neutron.
  Several neutrons are also released which can go on to split other nearby atoms, producing a nuclear
  chain reaction of sustained energy release. This nuclear reaction was the first of the two to be
  discovered. All commercial <a href="{% link reactors.md %}">nuclear power plants</a> in operation
  use this reaction to generate heat which they turn into electricity.
* **Fusion** is the combining of two small atoms such as Hydrogen or Helium to produce heavier atoms
  and energy. These reactions can release more energy than fission without producing as many
  radioactive byproducts. Fusion reactions occur in the sun, generally using Hydrogen as fuel and
  producing Helium as waste (fun fact: Helium was discovered in the sun and named after the Greek Sun
  God, Helios). This reaction has not been commercially developed yet and is a serious research
  interest worldwide, due to its promise of nearly limitless, low-pollution, and non-proliferative
  energy.

This site focuses on nuclear fission. In order to harness fusion, many daunting engineering and
physics problems must be solved. The time line for solving these problems is undefined, so we as a
society must turn to other solutions to solve the energy problems, at least for now. Fusion research
is exciting and making great progress, and it should continue to interest humanity.

## Energy density of various fuel sources

The amount of energy released in nuclear reactions is astounding. Table 1 shows how long a 100 Watt
light bulb could run from using 1 kg of various fuels. The natural uranium undergoes nuclear fission
and thus attains very high energy density (energy stored in a unit of mass).

<table class="table table-striped">
<tr><th>Material</th><th >Energy Density (MJ/kg)</th><th >100W light bulb time (1kg)</th></tr>
<tr><td>Wood</td><td>10</td><td>1.2 days</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ethanol</td><td>26.8</td><td>3.1 days</td></tr>
<tr><td>Coal</td><td>32.5</td><td>3.8 days</td></tr>
<tr><td>Crude oil</td><td>41.9</td><td>4.8 days</td></tr>
<tr><td>Diesel</td><td>45.8</td><td>5.3 days</td></tr>
<tr><td>Natural Uranium (LWR)</td><td>5.7x10<sup>5</sup></td><td>182 <em>years</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>Reactor Grade Uranium (LWR)</td><td>3.7x10<sup>6</sup></td><td>1,171 <em>years</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>Natural Uranium (breeder)</td><td>8.1x10<sup>7</sup></td><td>25,700 <em>years</em></td></tr>
<tr><td>Thorium (breeder)</td><td>7.9x10<sup>7</sup></td><td>25,300 <em>years</em></td></tr>
</table>
<p class="caption"><strong>Table 1</strong> Energy densities of various energy sources in MJ/kg and
in length of time that 1 kg of each material could run a 100W load. Natural uranium has undergone no
enrichment (0.7% U-235), reactor-grade uranium has 5% U-235. By the way, 1 kg of weapons grade
uranium (95% U-235) could power the entire USA for 177 seconds. All numbers assume 100%
thermal-to-electrical conversion. See our <a href="{% link energy-density.html %}">energy

<h2 class="text-center">Capabilities of Nuclear Power</h2>
<div class="col-md-4" markdown="1">
<h3 class="text-center">Sustainable</h3>

Table 1 sums the sustainability of nuclear power up quite well. However, there is quite a bit of
talk about nuclear fuel (Uranium) running low just like oil. Technically, this is a non-issue, as
nuclear waste <a href="{% link recycling.md %}">is recyclable</a>. Economically, it could become a
major issue. Today's commercial nuclear reactors burn less than 1% of the fuel that is mined for
them and the rest of it or so is thrown away (as depleted uranium and nuclear waste). The US
recycling program shut down in the '70s due to <a
href="{% link non-proliferation.md %}">proliferation</a> and economic concerns. Today, France and Japan
are recycling fuel with great success. New technology exists that can greatly reduce proliferation
concerns. Without recycling, the 2005 Uranium Reserves "Red Book" published by the U.N. IAEA
suggests that there are over 200 years of Uranium reserves at current demand. There is also a very
large supply of uranium dissolved in seawater at very low concentration. No one has found a
cheap-enough way to extract it yet, though people have come close. Nuclear reactors can also run on
<a href="{% link thorium.md %}">Thorium</a> fuel. 
</div>

<div class="col-md-4" markdown="1">
<h3 class="text-center">Ecological</h3>


In operation, <a href="{% link reactors.md %}">nuclear power plants</a> emit nothing into the
environment except hot water. The classic cooling tower icon of nuclear reactors is just that, a
cooling tower. Clean water vapor is all that comes out. Very little CO<sub>2</sub> or other
climate-changing gases come out of nuclear power generation (certainly some CO<sub>2</sub> is
produced during mining, construction, etc., but the amount is about 50 times less than coal and 25
times less than natural gas plants. Details coming soon). The spent nuclear fuel (<a
href="{% link waste.md %}">nuclear waste</a>) can be handled properly and disposed of geologically
without affecting the environment in any way. 

They're safe too. In March, 2013 the former NASA scientist James Hansen (of the 350 ppm limit fame)
published a paper showing that nuclear energy has saved a total of 1.8 million lives in its history
worldwide just by displacing air pollution that is a known killer<sup><a
href="{% link nuclear-energy.md %}#references">2</a></sup>. That includes any deaths nuclear energy has
been responsible for from its accidents. 
</div>

<div class="col-md-4" markdown="1">
<h3 class="text-center">Independent</h3>

With nuclear power, many countries can approach energy independence. Being &quot;addicted to
oil&quot; is a major national and global security  concern for various reasons. Using <a
href="{% link phev.md %}">electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs)</a> powered by
nuclear reactors, we could reduce our oil demands by orders of magnitude. Additionally, many nuclear
reactor designs can provide high-quality process heat in addition to electricity, which can in turn
be used to desalinate water, prepare hydrogen for fuel cells, or to heat neighborhoods, among many
other industrial processes.

<h2 class="text-center">Problems with Nuclear Power</h2>
<div class="col-md-4" markdown="1">
<h3 class="text-center">Nuclear Waste</h3>

When atoms split to release energy, the smaller atoms that are left behind are often left in excited
states, emitting energetic particles that can cause biological damage. Some of the longest lived
atoms don&rsquo;t decay to stability for hundreds of thousands of years. This <a
href="{% link waste.md %}">nuclear waste</a> must be controlled and kept out of the environment for
at least that long. Designing systems to last that long is a daunting task &mdash; one that been a
major selling point of anti-nuclear groups. 

</div>

<div class="col-md-4" markdown="1">
<h3 class="text-center">Dramatic accidents</h3>
Three major accidents have occurred in commercial power plants: Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and
Fukushima. <a href="{% link chernobyl-main.html %}">Chernobyl</a> was an uncontrolled steam explosion which released a
large amount of radiation into the environment, killing over 50 people, requiring a mass evacuation
of hundreds of thousands of people, and causing up to 4000 cancer cases. Three Mile Island was a
partial-core meltdown, where coolant levels dropped below the fuel and allowed some of it to melt.
No one was hurt and very little radiation was released, but the plant had to close, causing the
operating company and its investors to lose a lot of money. <a
href="{% link fukushima.html %}">Fukushima</a> was a station black-out caused by a huge Tsunami. Four
neighboring plants lost cooling and the <a href="{% link decay-heat.html %}">decay heat</a> melted the
cores. Radiation was released and the public was evacuated. These three accidents are very scary and
keep many people from being comfortable with nuclear power. 

</div>

<div class="col-md-4" markdown="1">
<h3 class="text-center">Cost</h3>
Nuclear power plants are larger and more complicated than other power plants. Many redundant safety
systems are built to keep the plant operating safely. This complexity causes the up-front cost of a
nuclear power plant to be much higher than for a comparable coal plant. Once the plant is built, the
fuel costs are much less than fossil fuel costs. In general, the older a nuclear plant gets, the
more money its operators make. The large capital cost keeps many investors from agreeing to finance
nuclear power plants.
