# Nuclear Engineering Reading List
##### By Nick Touran, Ph.D. P.E., 2021-05-24

This is a curated (and open-source) directory of reading material that may be interesting
for people just getting into nuclear technology.

<span class="label label-success">Open source</span> You can [edit this page on github]({{site.github_repo_url}}{{page.path}})

## Textbooks
Generally oldies but goodies.

## History books

Nuclear technology has a rich history with many fascinating developments. There are **dozens
upon dozens of deep-dive references** in the [reference section ]({% link
reactor_history.md %}#references) of our [nuclear reactor development history]({% link
reactor_history.md %}) page. But we'll put some here too.
