# What happened?

This is an old story from Canada's first nuclear reactor, ZEEP.

<blockquote class="blockquote" markdown="1">
To pump water into the reactor tank one had to push a button at the control desk
to start the pump. However, the pump ran only for a fraction of a minute at a
time, and then stopped. So an operator had to repeatedly push the button to keep
the pump running. Since this was rather tedious, one operator made a block of
wood that could be used to jam the pump button so the pump would run
continuously.

One day, a couple of researchers were on the top of the reactor
inserting detectors, and an operator was at the control desk pumping up the
heavy water, with the pump button jammed. Suddenly, the phone rang at the other
side of the building and the operator left the control desk to answer it,
leaving the pump running. The call took longer than expected and the next thing
the researchers heard was the shutoff rods dropping into the reactor. The
reactor had tripped on overpower. No one knows how much radiation the
researchers received since they had left their film badges in their coat pockets
on the floor below!

# Lessons

- Don't make extremely tedious processes. Staff will find ways to work
  around them in ways that might bypass whatever safety you were trying
  to enhance.
- Don't work on an unshielded reactor when it is being brought to power
- If you are working on a reactor, wear your dosimetry badge, even if
  it is offline.
