# What happened?

The Hyatt Regency Hotel in Kansas City, Missouri, suffered the structural
collapse of two overhead walkways after just a year of service. Loaded with
partygoers, the concrete and glass platforms cascaded down, crashing onto a
party in the lobby, killing 114 and injuring 216.

# Lessons

1. Investigators concluded that the underlying problem was a **lack of proper
   communication** between the engineer of record and the fabricator.

2. Drawings by the engineer were only preliminary sketches, but the fabricator
   interpreted them as finalized drawings; reports and court testimony cited a
   feedback loop of architects' **unverified assumptions**, each having believed
   that someone else had performed calculations and checked reinforcements but
   without any actual root in documentation or review channels.

3. The engineer **failed to review** the initial design and accepted the
   fabricators proposed plan via a phone call without performing necessary
   calculations or viewing sketches that would have revealed the intrinsic flaws â€”
   in particular, doubling the load on the fourth-floor beams.

4. Onsite workers had **neglected to report** noticing beams bending, and
   instead rerouted their heavy wheelbarrows around the unsteady walkways.

# Takeaway

Proper reviews and communication are critical to ensure unverified assumptions
and latent errors are captured before deploying a final product. For engineered
systems, the results can be fatal.
