# Video of radiation detection
##### 2007-04-12 

Here's a video of some radiation detection that we made. Basically, we use a
high-purity germanium gamma detector to see the spectrum of gamma-radiation
from various sources. Then, we take the sources over to a Geiger-Mueller survey
meter to get counts/minute readings. Alpha and beta radiation can be detected
by the GM meter. We detect radiation from A Cobalt-60 check source, salt
substitute, a Thorium lantern mantle, Uranium mineral, a smoke detector, and an
old fiesta-ware plate.
