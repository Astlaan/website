# Recycling Nuclear Waste and Breeder Reactors
##### By Nick Touran, March 2009

# What is nuclear recycling?   
Nuclear waste is recyclable. Once reactor fuel (uranium or thorium) is used in a reactor, it can be
treated and put into another reactor as fuel. In fact, typical reactors only extract a few percent
of the energy in their fuel. You could power the entire US electricity grid off of the energy in
nuclear waste for almost 100 years ([details]({% link factoids.md %})). If you recycle the waste,
the final waste that is left over decays to harmlessness within a few hundred years, rather than a
million years as with standard (unrecycled) nuclear waste. This page explains how this interesting
process is possible. 

## Nuclear Transformations
<img class="pull-right" src="/img/breeding.svg" title="An image of U-238 becoming Pu-239 via neutron absorption and two beta-decays." alt="An image of U-238 becoming Pu-239 via neutron absorption and two beta-decays."/>
Before you go on, recall that Uranium exists in nature as 2 <a
href="{% link isotopes.md %}">isotopes</a>: the less common U-235, and the more common U-238.
Conventional reactors mainly split U-235 to produce power, and the U-238 is often considered
useless. When a standard reactor runs low on U-235, it must be refueled, even though there is a lot
of U-238 still in there. 

A common type of nuclear reaction is called beta-decay. When a nucleus has more neutrons than it
would like to have, it often beta-decays by breaking a neutron into a proton and an electron. The
electron (called a beta-particle in this case, since it originated in the nucleus) flies off into
nature, and the main result seen in the nucleus is a neutron converting to a proton (see figure). 


When U-238 absorbs a neutron in a nuclear reactor, it becomes U-239, which is just the isotope of
Uranium with one extra neutron than U-238. This beta-decays quickly and becomes Np-239. Then, the
Np-239 beta-decays again to become Pu-239, which is a fissile isotope that can power nuclear
reactors. 

The "useless" U-238 is the secret to recycling nuclear fuel. When it absorbs a single
neutron, it goes through a series of nuclear reactions within a few days and turns into a very
splittable isotope of Plutonium, Pu-239. The Pu-239 acts a lot like the U-235 that powers
conventional reactors, so if you convert your U-238 to Pu-239 as you run your reactor, you can then
use that Pu-239 to continue powering your reactor, or others!


## Nuclear Fuel cycles
A nuclear fuel cycle is the path that nuclear fuel (Uranium, Thorium, Plutonium, etc.) takes as it
is used to generate power in a nuclear reactor. Our <a href="{% link fuel-cycle.md %}">fuel cycle
page</a> has more info. They describe where the material comes from and where it ends up. Different
fuel cycles range from very simple to fairly complicated. We describe several of these below. 

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><strong>Note:</strong> Besides the U-Pu fuel cycle described here, the <a href="{% link thorium.md %}">Thorium-Uranium fuel cycle</a> is analogous and can also be recycled.</div>

### Once Through Cycle
<img src="/img/fuelcycle_once_through.svg"  alt="A picture of a once through fuel cycle" width="500" height="97" usemap="#oncemap"/>
<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> A once-through fuel cycle. Put your mouse over each image for more info. </p>

The simplest fuel cycle is the once-through cycle. It is the de-facto standard in most operating
nuclear power plants, with a few exceptions in Europe and Asia. Uranium is mined, enriched, used in
a reactor (where it becomes radioactive nuclear waste), and then stored until it is no longer
dangerously radioactive. While this cycle is cheap, there are two major problems with it. Firstly,
the waste is radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years. No one has been able to design a
repository that is convincingly capable of storing material for that long. Secondly, Uranium is not
the most abundant element on Earth, and in this kind of cycle, the global supply of cheap uranium
could run low within 200 years. So much for sustainability! There are some deep-burn once-through
cycles out there that have good sustainability properties though.

<h3 id="closed">Closed Fuel Cycle</h3>
<img src="/img/fuelcycle_recycle.svg" title="Several countries recycle the depleted uranium and plutonium back into standard reactors." alt="A picture of a MOX recycle fuel cycle." width="500" height="278" usemap="#recyclemap" />
<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 2.</strong> A closed fuel cycle. Here nuclear material is recycled. Put your mouse over each image for more info. </p>
Closing the fuel cycle involves recycling the nuclear waste as new fuel. Since the main component of
nuclear waste is Uranium-238 (which can be transmuted to Plutonium, especially with advanced breeder
reactors), we can get more energy out of the waste than in a once-through cycle <a
href="{% link factoids.md %}">(see factoid 2 to see how much)</a>. The recycling plant separates
the good stuff from the bad stuff. The bad stuff is mostly fission products, the atoms that a
Uranium atom becomes after it splits in the fission process. These fission products mostly decay to
safe levels within 300-500 years, which is significantly shorter than standard nuclear waste. So, by
closing the fuel cycle with standard reactors, we address the issue of nuclear waste identified in
the once-through cycle. In this case, nuclear waste is a tractable problem. But most of the
reactivity is coming from the mine, since standard reactors burn most of the fissile nuclide, U-235.
Also, the reprocessing technology is expensive and separates out pure Plutonium, which could
possibly be stolen, bringing a rogue entity closer to having a nuclear weapon. For these reasons,
the USA does not currently recycle. There are ways to solve these issues.

<h3 id="breeder">Breeder Fuel Cycle</h3>
<img src="/img/fuelcycle_breeder.svg" title="Breeder reactors produce enough plutonium to fuel several standard reactors without mines or enrichment plants." alt="A picture of a breeder recycle fuel cycle." width="650" height="220"  usemap="#breedermap"/>
<a href="{% link fast-reactor.html %}">Breeder reactors</a> can create as much or more fissile
material (atoms that readily split) than they use. These special reactors are designed to have extra
neutrons flying around, so that some can convert U-238 to Pu-239 (see above) and the others can run
the reactor. Often, these special reactors are deemed &quot;fast&quot; reactors because the neutrons
are moving through the reactor at higher speeds, on average. In a full breeder fuel cycle, we get
the maximum use of the Uranium resources on Earth, and what we already know exists can last tens of
thousands of years. The cycle has cost and proliferation concerns associated with any closed cycle.
Additionally, we have significantly less operational experience with breeder reactors, so we would
need to train builders and operators for such a machine. Using a Thorium cycle instead of a
Uranium-Plutonium cycle may allow breeding in less exotic reactors. Using this kind of fuel cycle,
nuclear power can truly be considered sustainable.
