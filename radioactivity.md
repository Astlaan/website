# What is radiation? What is radioactivity?

A radioactive atom is one that spontaneously emits energetic particles or waves (known as radiation). 
This radiation is emitted when an unstable (i.e. radioactive) nucleus transforms to some other nucleus 
or energy level. Imagine a big ball made of magnets that&rsquo;s spinning really fast. Sometimes a few 
pieces of the magnet will shoot out and hit the wall. That&rsquo;s kind of what radiation is like. As 
it applies to <a href="{% link nuclear-energy.md %}">nuclear energy</a>, many materials created during the 
operation of a <a href="{% link reactors.md %}">reactor</a> are unstable. As they decay over varying 
lengths of time (from microseconds to hundreds of thousands of years), they emit energetic particles 
or waves. The energy carried by this radiation is often sufficient to cause damage to biological cells 
and is therefore a health risk. Thus, radiation is the primary cause of safety concerns related to nuclear energy.

# Types of Nuclear Radiation
There are several types of particles or waves that may shoot out of a radioactive nucleus. Alpha 
particles, beta particles, gamma rays, and neutrons are the most common forms of ionizing (i.e. dangerous) 
radiation.

### Alpha Particles
Named *alpha* because they were the first to be discovered, these particles are made up of 2 protons 
and 2 neutrons: the helium nucleus. Often, large atoms decay by emitting an energetic alpha particle. 
These particles are relatively large and positively charged, and therefore do not penetrate through 
matter very well. A thin piece of paper can stop almost any alpha particle. However, the particles 
cause extreme damage of materials that they stop in by displacing atoms as they slow. Paper under 
sustained alpha-irradiation would degrade. 

### Beta Particles
Beta particles are energetic electrons that are emitted from the nucleus. They are born when a 
neutron decays to a proton. Since neutrons are neutral particles and protons are positive, 
conservation of charge requires a negatively charged electron to be emitted. Some isotopes 
decay by converting a proton to a neutron, thus emitting a positron (an anti-electron). These 
particles can penetrate matter more than can alpha particles, and it takes a small aluminum plate 
to stop most beta particles. 

### Gamma rays
Gamma rays are photons that are emitted from the nucleus. Often an atom in an excited 
state will de-excite by emitting a gamma ray. Gamma rays are similar to light waves and 
x-rays, except they are usually much higher frequency and consequently, more energetic. 
This radiation has no charge, and can penetrate most matter easily, requiring lead bricks 
for shielding.

# Common sources of radiation

### "Man-made" radiation
#### Smoke detectors

</div>
Smoke detectors make use of the isotope Americium-241. This isotope emits alpha-particles at energies up 
to 5.4 MeV. The energetic alpha particles are used to ionize air. Once the air is ionized, a small current 
runs through it. When smoke enters the chamber, the current experiences an increase in resistance and a 
circuit sounds the alarm.

#### Coal-burning power plants
Coal is an impure fuel, and it usually contains 1.3 ppm of uranium and 3.4 ppm of thorium (not to 
mention arsenic, mercury, and sulfur). When coal burns, these isotopes are emitted into the atmosphere, 
where they enter our ecosystem. This leads to the astounding fact that the population effective dose 
equivalent from coal plants is 100 times that from nuclear plants.


#### Nuclear weapon detonations
The hundreds of atmospheric nuclear weapons tests that occurred before they were banned by the 
1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty left long-lived radioisotopes in the atmosphere. Some of these are 
still in the atmosphere and account for some of our daily dose.

### Natural radiation
Radon gas
This natural occurring gas comes from soil and is found throughout the world. It emits alpha 
particles, and can therefore damage DNA and lead to cancer if inhaled. The EPA recommends 
you check your house for radon gas.

#### Cosmic rays
Cosmic rays are energetic particles that originate outside of earth, in the sun, distant stars, 
galaxies, and supernovae. Most of these are protons. The atmosphere shields us from most 
cosmic rays, but during air travel, one will accumulate much higher dose. Don't 
believe it? Check out our [Radiation on Flights]({% link _posts/2014-05-17-radiation-on-flights.html %}) page.

# Background readings in Ann Arbor, MI

For a class in 2005, with no radioactive sources within range, we measured a long (30 minutes +) 
reading with a high-purity germanium (HPGe) gamma-ray detector system. We then identified the source 
of each peak. The spectrum is shown in the figure. Click it for the identifications. HPGe detectors 
are known for excellent resolutions, and as you can see, many peaks are clearly visible. Each one 
represents a specific nuclear reaction. Some major gamma-rays are highlighted on the figure. 
Thallium-208 is a decay-product of <a href="{% link thorium.md %}">Thorium</a>-232, which is 
naturally present in soil. Protactinium-234 results from the natural alpha-decay of Uranium-238. 
Potassium-40 is found all around, including in bananas and in salt-substitutes at the grocery store.
