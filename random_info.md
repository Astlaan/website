Our [random reactor generator](./random) gives you a random reactor idea. It uses a few
acronyms. This page explains them. 

### Coolants

Most coolants are self-explanatory but there are a few things worth mentioning:

* CO2 is carbon dioxide
* H2O is water or steam or ice or plasma-water
* D2O is deuterium-dioxide, aka heavy water. It uses hydrogen isotopes that have one extra
  neutron.
* exotic covers all gasses not listed just to be exhaustive

Coolants can additionally in any phase depending on their temperature and pressure. So we
include solid, liquid, gas, and plasma forms of al coolants. Technically we could do this
to moderators and fuel as well but we chose not to. 

### Fuels
The fuel forms are fairly well-known, but we used some acronyms in the type of fuel:

* HEU -- High-enriched uranium (anything enriched >20%)
* WGPu -- Weapons-grade plutonium, often leftover from weapons programs
* RGPu -- Reactor-grade plutonium, often from reprocessed nuclear waste
* HALEU -- High-assay low-enriched uranium; a easy word to say any uranium enriched
  between 5 and 20%. 
* LEU -- low-enriched uranium; enriched but not over 5%
* DU -- depleted uranium; mostly U-238, often tails of an enrichment plant
* NU -- natural uranium; right out of the dirt
* UNF -- Used nuclear fuel; just another blanket term for spent nuclear fuel/nuclear waste

### All combinations
There are currently 1,360,800 different reactor concepts in the database. If you want to
see them all printed out, download [this giant zip file](./assets/all_reactors.zip).

### But why?
This is kind of a tongue-in-cheek hat-tip to a common misconception of nuclear amateurs
who think that a reactor idea alone is a big part of improving nuclear energy's service to
humanity. In reality, reactor concept ideas are a dime a dozen, while [developing and
deploying reactors]({% link reactor_history.md %}) is the challenging part. Innovations
and advances in reactor design process, reactor construction, and reactor operation are
needed vastly more than new reactor concepts.
