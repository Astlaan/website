title: Sodium and Salt are different in nuclear

description: > 
    While most of us think salt when we hear about sodium, the two words
    mean significantly different things in the context of advanced nuclear
    technology. This post explains the difference between salt and sodium.

Most of us use the words *sodium* and *salt* interchangeably. After all, this is how they're
used in nutrition: *low sodium* means something's not too *salty*. However, when these
terms are used in the context of nuclear technology, they refer to significantly different
concepts.

### Liquid sodium metal
Elemental sodium (Na) heated up so it flows like Mercury or
solder. (Sodium metal is not a salt!)

Sodium metal is used as a low-pressure coolant. It transfers heat extremely well and can
keep a core cool without external power. It has been used extensively in both slow and
fast neutron reactors (i.e. SGRs and SFRs).

### Molten salt
Molten salt is made of cations and anions held in ionic bonds heated up to
flow as liquid.

Molten salts have been used as a fluid fuel in 2 historical reactors: the ARE and the
MSRE. They have also been proposed as the coolant for solid-fuel reactors. Molten salt is
used in nuclear concepts and in operating solar-thermal facilities as thermal storage,
where energy can be stored for several hours as heat.

To make it even more confusing, some reactors use both sodium metal and molten salt. For
example, the [Aircraft Reactor Experiment
(ARE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_Reactor_Experiment) used molten salt fuel
and used sodium metal to cool the reflector. Some modern reactor concepts also
utilize both sodium metal and molten salt.

Note that some salts, like Sodium-Chloride (table salt) contain sodium. This is the sodium
people refer to in nutrition. Others salts (like Potassium-Chloride and FLiBe) do not
contain any sodium.
