title: How sustainable is nuclear energy?

    Some people claim nuclear fuel is inexhaustible and circular, others say
    we'll run out soon. Turns out, it's roughly as inexhaustible as sunlight.

As you saw in our [energy flow diagram]({% link energy-flow.md %}), our energy
resources are either new (derived directly from sunlight: solar, wind, hydro), old
(fossilized plant matter), or really old (nuclear fission, geothermal, fusion).

Most people want to spend our limited time and money building clean energy sources that
will work out in the really long term.

So can nuclear fuel power humanity for a long time?

We need some facts:

* Total world energy consumption of primary energy in 2019 was about 584 exajoules ([BP
  Statistical Review of World Energy
2020](https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/energy-economics/statistical-review/bp-stats-review-2020-full-report.pdf)
* A modern light-water reactor can pull an average of 60 MWd/kg out of its 4.8% enriched
  nuclear fuel ([AP1000 docs](https://aris.iaea.org/PDF/AP1000.pdf))
* One kg of 4.8% enriched uranium requires 9.5 kgU natural uranium input to the enrichment
  plant (and 7.8 SWU) (any old [SWU calculator](https://www.urenco.com/swu-calculator)
* A breeder reactor with a recycling fuel cycle can pull [about 900 MWd/kg]({% link
  energy-density.md %}) out of non-enriched nuclear fuel (natural or depleted uranium or
thorium)
* There are 6.1 million tonnes of uranium in reasonably assured deposits ([World
  Nuclear Uranium](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/supply-of-uranium.aspx))
* There are 6.3 million tonnes of thorium in reasonably assured deposits ([World
  Nuclear Thorium](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/thorium.aspx)
* Uranium exists in seawater at an average concentration of 0.003 ppm (also World Nuclear
  Uranium)
* There are about 332 million cubic miles of water on Earth, 96.5% of it is in the ocean
  ([USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/how-much-water-there-earth?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects)).
  At a density of 1 gram/cm$$^3$$, this comes out to 1.4 yottagrams of water, or 1.4e21 kg)
* At 0.003 ppm, this means there are about 4000 million tonnes of uranium in seawater
* The average crustal concentration of uranium is about 2.8 ppm ([WN Uranium](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/supply-of-uranium.aspx)
