title: What is nuclear energy?
description: >
    Nuclear fission power plants make sustainable, reliable, and clean heat and electricity
    with almost no lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. However, they are expensive and generate radioactive
    material. Here you will learn about the nuances of nuclear energy.

            The formal definition of energy is "the ability to do work". In practice, 
            if we can enlist machines powered by some form of energy, we can 
            get what we need to survive and thrive without having to work so hard.
            Rather than farming all day every day, energy allows a small fraction
            of people to farm, allowing everyone else to farm only if they choose to. 
            That freedom to choose is a luxury of a high-energy lifestyle.

        <h3>Quality of life is correlated with energy use</h3>
        <img title="HDI chart" class="r-stretch" src="/img-slide/hdi.jpg"/>
        <aside class="notes">
            Quality of life is hard to quantify, but the UN has attempted to do
            so with the Human Development Index (HDI), which combines life
            expectancy, education, and GDP. When you plot it vs. per capita
            electricity use, you see these two strong asymptotes. On the flat
            one you see the US and Norway. Here, we could reduce our energy
            usage a little bit without having a big impact on our lives. But on
            the low energy line, we can see that a tiny bit of extra energy is
            correlated with a massive improvement in quality of life.  This
            correlation does not imply causation, but is very strong.

            into heavy nuclei in great cataclysmic actions such as supernova and
            neutron star mergers. These made things like nuclear fuel atoms

            Uranium is found in nature with 2 isotopes. 99.3% of it is Uranium-238. The
            rest is Uranium-235 with fewer neutrons. They are chemically identical, but
            only U-235 readily splits and releases energy in a power plant.

            Generally, we want to increase the fraction of U-235, and we do so
            by spinning it really fast so that the heavier atoms move
            preferentially to the outside. This process is called enrichment.

            Given enriched uranium, we then fabricate the fuel into ceramic
            pellets like these. Note that because uranium isotopes have very
            long half-lives (billions of years), it's perfectly safe to hold
            with a gloved hand.

            The pellets are then stacked into vertical cladding tubes and

            A neutron chain reaction occurs when one neutron fissions one nucleus, releasing
            the cosmic energy and also a few extra neutrons. These extra neutrons go on to 
            split a neighboring nucleus, and the chain reaction continues. This allows us to 
            access that slowly-bubbling-out energy from the ore much faster, enabling us to 
            do useful things like make electricity.

            We use a nuclear power plant to convert all the heat being released
            in the core into usable electricity. To do this, we just pump a
            coolant (typically water) through the core, where it heats up and
            generates steam. The steam blows through a turbine, like a giant
            pinwheel, which spins. The shaft is hooked to a generator that has
            magnets on it. The spinning magnets push electrons through coils
            which are attached to power lines and come to your house, where the
            moving electrons can be used in your appliances and lights.

            Nuclear reactors propel the US Navy fleet of submarines and aircraft
            carriers. This allows them to operate at high speed for vast
            distances without needing to refuel or use oxygen. Right after
            nuclear reactors powered submarines, they went on grand adventures
            like to the north pole under the ice and around the world submerged;
            things utterly impossible before nuclear power. 

            We also ran a few merchant ships like the NS Savannah, allowing decarbonized
            shipping.

            When any heat source is converted to electricity, thermodynamics
            requires a certain amount of 'waste heat'. Rather than simply
            putting this heat in the air or water, reactors can be configured to
            pipe the warm water up to 100 km away to provide space heating in
            homes, greenhouses, ponds, and more. This is a fantastic way to
            decarbonize the fossil-heavy heating industry.
